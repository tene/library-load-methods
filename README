Run 'make' to build three executables, showing three different ways of loading compiled data, resolved at different times:

* demo-static   compiled in once at compile-time
* demo-dynamic  resolved once at program start time by the linker
* demo-runtime  loaded by path at runtime in the program

Use the 'run-dynamic' script included to run demo-dynamic with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to $(pwd)

With a static inclusion, you need to extra files, but the data will never change.  With dynamic linking, you ran replace the file, but it's loaded by the linker, so you don't get any choice in your program about what gets loaded.  With runtime loading, you choose exactly what to load.
