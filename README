Run 'make' to build three executables, showing three different ways of loading compiled data, resolved at different times:

* demo-static   compiled in once at compile-time
* demo-dynamic  resolved once at program start time by the linker
* demo-runtime  loaded by path at runtime in the program

Use the 'run-dynamic' script included to run demo-dynamic with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to $(pwd)
